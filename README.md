# Izhikevich-Model
This script simulates a small neural network using the Izhikevich model. It initializes neuron states, defines connectivity, applies deep brain stimulation (DBS), and incorporates spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The simulation tracks membrane potential, phase, and spikes, visualizing neuron activity over time.
